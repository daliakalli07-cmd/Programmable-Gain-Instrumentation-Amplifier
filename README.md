# Programmable-Gain-Instrumentation-Amplifier
This project presents a programmable-gain instrumentation amplifier using OP07 op-amps and MOSFET switches for electronic gain control. A digital decoder selects precision resistors to adjust gain. The design ensures high accuracy, low noise, and flexibility for automated measurement systems.
